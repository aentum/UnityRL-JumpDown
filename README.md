Jump Down is a simpler vision of a classic game called [ns-shaft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SksNwLmSSE&t=33). The objective is to stay between the top and bottom borders of the game by jumping down between ascending platforms. Collecting a yellow ball gives bonus points.

[Here](https://youtu.be/Bd1D22kLIxU) you can see a short demo of my agent playing the game, after 500,000 training steps. There is a lot of room for improvement, and I am working to improve its performance. Playing with this project I learned a lot about setting up training environment and parameters. I also had chances to experiment with concepts like curiosity.
